Run qmake first to generate the Makefile:
    qmake

Then compile the source code according to the generated Makefile:
    make

Now simply run the executable:
    ./iris

 ...and then File -> Open a bitmap of your choice.

Alternatively, make the application automatically load a certain bitmap image with:
    ./iris someImage.bmp
